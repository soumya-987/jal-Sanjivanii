Data Processor (FastAPI) â€” Run locally

1. Create venv: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
2. Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start server: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`
4. Open: `http://localhost:8000`

If you cannot install Python dependencies on your system, you can still use the client-only mode:

- Open `/workspace/static/index.html` directly in your browser. It will parse CSV/TSV/JSON locally and show the same summaries as the server.
